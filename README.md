## Code Snippet
```javascript

```
<!-- This on click function of the code applies to each button of the daily scheduler. It allows the page to save the 
text area to local storage so even on a page refresh of the browser, the code is saved locally. The second half of
the code snippet loads the text area for each hour of the day if it had been saved previously.  -->
